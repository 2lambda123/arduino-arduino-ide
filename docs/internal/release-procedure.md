# Release Procedure

## üó∫Ô∏è Merge localization sync PR

A pull request titled "**Update translation files**" is submitted periodically by the "**github-actions**" bot to pull in the localization data from [**Transifex**](https://www.transifex.com/arduino-1/ide2/dashboard/).

If there is an open PR, this must be merged before making the release.

It will be shown in these search results:

https://github.com/arduino/arduino-ide/pulls/app%2Fgithub-actions

## ‚öô Create the release on GitHub

First of all, you need to **set the new version in all the `package.json` files** across the app (`./package.json`, `./arduino-ide-extension/package.json`, and `./electron-app/package.json`), create a PR, and merge it on the `main` branch.

To do so, you can make use of the `update:version` script.

For example, if you want to release the version `<YOUR_VERSION>`, you should run the following commands:

```text
git checkout main
git pull
git checkout -b version-<YOUR_VERSION>
yarn update:version <YOUR_VERSION>
git commit -am <YOUR_VERSION>
git push origin version-<YOUR_VERSION>
```

replacing `<YOUR_VERSION>` with the version you want to release. Then create a PR and merge it.

Then, you need to **create and push the new tag** and wait for the release to appear on [the "**Releases**" page](https://github.com/arduino/arduino-ide/releases).

‚ö† Doing this will create a new release and users who already have the IDE installed will be notified from the automatic updater that a new version is available. Do not push the tag if you don't want that.

```text
git checkout main
git pull
git tag -a <YOUR_VERSION> -m "<YOUR_VERSION>"
git push origin <YOUR_VERSION>
```

Pushing a tag will trigger a **GitHub Actions** workflow on the `main` branch. Check the "**Arduino IDE**" workflow and see that everything goes right. If the workflow succeeds, a new release will be created automatically and you should see it on the ["**Releases**"](https://github.com/arduino/arduino-ide/releases) page.

## üìÑ Create the changelog

**Create GitHub issues for the known issues** that we haven't solved in the current release:

https://github.com/arduino/arduino-ide/issues

From the ["**Releases**"](https://github.com/arduino/arduino-ide/releases) page, edit the release notes following the **Keep A Changelog** scheme:

https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/#how

Add a list of mentions of GitHub users who contributed to the release in any of the following ways (ask @per1234):

- Submitted a PR that was merged
- Made a valuable review of a PR
- Submitted an issue that was resolved
- Provided valuable assistance with the investigation of an issue that was resolved

Add a "**Known Issues**" section at the bottom of the changelog.

## ‚úé Update the "**Software**" Page

Open a PR on the [bcmi-labs/wiki-content](https://github.com/bcmi-labs/wiki-content) repository to update the links and texts.

‚ÑπÔ∏è If you don't have access to the repo, ask in the `#team_wedo` **Slack** channel.

**‚ùó Make sure all the links to the new IDE build are working.**<br />
If they aren't, there has probably been some issue with [the "**Arduino IDE**" workflow run](https://github.com/arduino/arduino-ide/actions/workflows/build.yml) triggered when pushing the tag during the "**Create the release on GitHub**" step of the release procedure.

Ask for a review of the PR and merge it.

Follow the ["**Production (subset of https://arduino.cc)**" instructions](https://github.com/bcmi-labs/wiki-content#production-subset-of-httpsarduinocc) in the `bcmi-labs/wiki-content` repository readme to deploy the updated "**Software**" page content.

When the deploy workflow is done, check if links on the "**Software**" page are working:
