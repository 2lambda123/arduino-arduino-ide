# Advanced usage

## Advanced settings

The Arduino IDE's primary settings are accessible via the **File > Preferences** menu item. These provide all the configuration capability required by the average user to develop sketches.

Arduino IDE has some additional settings which may be of interest to advanced users who want to do things such as fine tune the behavior of the application or increase log output while investigating a problem.

These advanced settings can be accessed by the following procedure:

1. Press the <kbd>**Ctrl**</kbd>+<kbd>**Shift**</kbd>+<kbd>**P**</kbd> keyboard shortcut (<kbd>**Command**</kbd>+<kbd>**Shift**</kbd>+<kbd>**P**</kbd> for macOS users) to open the "**Command Palette**".
1. Select the "**Preferences: Open Settings (UI)**" command from the menu.

This will open a "**Preferences**" view in the IDE. Once you are finished adjusting settings, it can be closed by clicking the **X** icon on the "**Preferences**" tab.
